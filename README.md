# SmartBox-for-delivery
### Ardrino controlled smart box with two factor authentication for delivery of food and other sensitive items.<br>

#### Idea:
- The idea is to make a delivery box which once closed and locked by the restaurant, can only be opened by the intended customer using a secure key.
- We can use this product to store personal belongings like ornaments, important documents and money kept in offices and in organisations also.
